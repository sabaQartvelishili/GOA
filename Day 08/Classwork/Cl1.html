<h3><i>Toyota company since 1978.
     The Supra's first design was based on the body of the Toyota Celica, but longer and wider.
      From 1986, the Supra was separated from the Celica, after which it became a separate model. Along with this, Toyota stopped using the Celica prefix and the name of the car is exactly Supra.
     The first, second and third generations of Supra were produced at the Tahara plant, and the fourth generation at Toyota.</i></h3>
